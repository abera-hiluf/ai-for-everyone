Week 2 — AI and Machine Learning Notes
1. AI Project Example

Voice-Activated Smart Home Assistant

Data Collection: Record phrases like "Hey Assistant" from multiple speakers.

Training: Model learns to recognize the wake word using ML algorithms.

Deployment: Install in a device; refine with new user data to handle accents/noise.

2. Key Concepts

Machine Learning: Builds models to make predictions automatically.

Data Science: Analyzes data to support human decision-making.

AI Project Thinking:

Intersection of AI capabilities & business value → feasible + valuable projects.

Focus on automating tasks, not entire jobs.

Identify business pain points for AI solutions.

3. Frameworks & Tools

Deep Learning: PyTorch, TensorFlow, PaddlePaddle

NLP: Hugging Face

Classical ML: Scikit-learn, R

Research: arXiv for latest AI papers

4. Hardware & Deployment

CPUs & GPUs for computation; TPUs for AI acceleration

Deployment Options:

Cloud → remote servers

On-Premises → local servers

Edge → local device processing (e.g., smart speakers, cars)

5. Takeaways

Small datasets are enough to start AI projects.

Technical & business diligence ensures projects are feasible and valuable.

AI tools and frameworks allow building models efficiently.
