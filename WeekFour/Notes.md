# WEEK 4

Goldilocks Rule for AI
- A realistic view of AI is essential; it should neither be seen as a solution to all problems nor as a threat to humanity.
- Overly optimistic views may lead to unrealistic expectations about AI's capabilities, while pessimistic fears often stem from misconceptions about AI's potential dangers.

Limitations of AI
- Explainability is a significant challenge; many AI systems operate as "black boxes," making it difficult to understand their decision-making processes.
- AI can exhibit bias and discrimination if trained on flawed data, and addressing these issues is an ongoing effort within the AI community.

Economic Impact and Security Concerns
- AI is creating substantial economic value and has the potential for further growth across various industries.
- There are risks of adversarial attacks on AI systems, which necessitate careful consideration in their deployment and use.

Understanding AI Bias
- AI can learn unhealthy stereotypes from data, such as text on the internet, leading to biased outputs in analogies.
- For example, an AI might associate "man is to computer programmer" with "woman is to homemaker," reflecting societal stereotypes.

Causes of Bias in AI
- AI systems represent words using numerical values derived from their usage in data, which can perpetuate biases.
- If the training data is skewed, the AI's understanding and outputs will also be biased, affecting decisions in hiring, facial recognition, and loan approvals.

Mitigating Bias in AI
- Researchers are developing technical solutions to reduce bias, such as zeroing out biased numerical representations.
- Using diverse and inclusive data, along with transparency and auditing processes, can help identify and address biases in AI systems. A diverse workforce can also contribute to creating more equitable AI applications.

Understanding Adversarial Attacks
- AI systems can be easily fooled by minor changes to input data, which may be imperceptible to humans.
- Examples include misclassifying images of animals or objects due to slight pixel alterations.

Examples of Adversarial Attacks
- Researchers have demonstrated that physical modifications, like wearing special glasses or placing stickers on stop signs, can deceive AI systems.
- These attacks can have serious implications, especially in safety-critical applications like self-driving cars.

Defending Against Adversarial Attacks
- Ongoing research aims to develop defenses against these attacks, though they may slow down AI systems.
- The landscape of AI security resembles an arms race, where attackers and defenders continuously adapt to each other's strategies.

Understanding AI's Impact on Jobs
- AI is significantly expanding the scope of automation, potentially displacing 400 to 800 million jobs by 2030, according to McKinsey Global Institute.
- Other studies, like one from Goldman Sachs, estimate a lower figure of 300 million jobs lost by 2033, indicating uncertainty in predictions.

Job Displacement and Creation
- While many jobs may be displaced, there is optimism that AI could create even more jobs than it eliminates.
- Future jobs may include roles that currently do not exist, such as drone traffic optimizer or custom DNA-based drug designer.

Estimating Job Displacement
- Studies assess job tasks to determine their susceptibility to automation, with a focus on tasks rather than entire jobs.
- Jobs with tasks that are highly automatable face a higher risk of displacement.

Jobs Most Affected by AI
- McKinsey's research identifies the top 10 jobs with the highest potential for automation, which includes various occupation groups like office work and customer service.
- Generative AI tools have increased the automation potential for jobs involving writing and communication.

Navigating the Future of Work
- Possible solutions to address job displacement include conditional basic income to support learning and reskilling.
- Building a lifelong learning society is essential, as continuous education will help individuals adapt to changing job markets.

Working in AI
- Individuals in existing professions, like radiology, are encouraged to learn AI to enhance their expertise rather than abandoning their current careers.
- Combining domain knowledge with AI skills can lead to unique job opportunities.
