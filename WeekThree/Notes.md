# Week 3 â€“ Detailed Notes (AI for Everyone)

## ðŸš˜ How Various AI Technologies Work Together in Autonomous Driving

### 1. Input and Detection
- Self-driving cars use **cameras, radar, and LiDAR** to gather information about their surroundings.  
- They detect other vehicles and pedestrians using **machine learning models** for accurate identification.

### 2. Motion Planning
- After detection, the data is processed by **motion planning software**.  
- The system calculates:
  - Safest path and driving speed  
  - Steering angles  
  - Acceleration or braking commands  
- Goal: **Avoid collisions and drive smoothly.**

### 3. Additional Components
- **GPS, accelerometers, and digital maps** improve navigation and safety.  
- Systems also:
  - Predict movements of other vehicles and pedestrians  
  - Detect lane markings, traffic signals, and road obstacles
