# Week 1 – AI For Everyone (Andrew Ng)

## What I Learned
- AI is a **general-purpose technology** that can transform every industry.
- **Narrow AI** is the most common today: AI systems designed for a specific task (e.g., speech recognition, spam filter).
- **AI strategy** requires knowing what AI can and cannot do.
- AI excels at tasks that:
  - Take a human less than 1 second of thought.
  - Can be solved with data patterns (e.g., image recognition, recommendations).
- AI does **not** think like humans; it is pattern recognition, not reasoning.

## Key Insights
- Businesses succeed with AI by:
  1. Having data.
  2. Identifying feasible AI tasks.
  3. Integrating AI into workflows.
- **AI teams** should align with business leaders to define projects.
- AI is changing job roles; it creates opportunities but also shifts skills needed.

## Reflection
This week gave me a **big-picture understanding of AI’s role** in society and business.  
As a coding practice, I also tried a simple example of Linear Regression with Python’s `scikit-learn`.
